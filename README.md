# so_long


This project comprises a very small 2D game aimed at familiarizing developers with textures, sprites, and fundamental gameplay elements. Utilizing basic graphic libraries like MiniLibX, it helps enhance skills in window management, event handling, colors, textures, and more. The project entails creating a 2D game by taking a map description file as input. The primary objective of the game is for the player to collect all collectible items on the map and escape via the shortest route. The game's graphic management should ensure smooth display within the window and proper handling of window events. The map must consist of walls, collectible items, and free spaces, with a valid path to navigate. The project must adhere to specified guidelines and exit cleanly in case of any configuration errors.
